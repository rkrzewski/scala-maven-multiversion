This is a fairly complete example of a Maven project that builds a set of
jars for different Scala releases from a source tree composed of shared, and
Scala release specific sections.

To add support for new scala release, a profile in the POM needs to be
cloned and unpdate with relevant version numbers, and source and directories
dedicated to the new release need to be created.

To build & test the project invoke one of the following:

mvn -P2.9 clean install exec:java
mvn -P2.10 clean install exec:java

To use this project with eclipse you need: ScalaIDE, m2e, m2eclipse-scala
m2e connctor and buildhelper plugin m2e connector. While importing the
project into Eclipse, enter profile name into Advanced > Profile field in
the import dialog, in order to have correct Eclipse classpath generated.
You can switch the profile throguh project properties context menu > Maven >
Profiles.
